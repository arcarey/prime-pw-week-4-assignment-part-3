    <ul>
      <li>is it common to override css style with a style assignment directly inside of the HTML tag?</li>
      <li>I tried to google this, but had trouble finding an answer: I tried to reassign the array passed as an argument into empty() as an empty array, but it treated it like a local variable and reverted to it's original pre-function value. So if I ran the function inside a console.log() it would return an empty array, but the next time I called it, it would revert to the old array value. So I used a loop to empty the array instead. I'm wondering if there's a way to do it with a simple '=' assignment</li>
